# My-Portfolio


##Description In this website strucuture i have created a portfolio that is strictly made of HTML, and CSS elements. If you look into the coding you will see how i connected the CSS and HTML to work together to implements certain feautures on the portfolio such as, the about me section , and the nav bar to have clickable links.
Further more, ive have also changed the screen view so that the user viewing can seeing the portfolio whichever device they so happen to be using.
